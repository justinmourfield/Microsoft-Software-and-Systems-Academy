1. ASP.Net was created in 2002.

2. Its essentially a middle man in between users and server functions that allow controls to operate autonomously from each other and present a GUI over the web linked to a server that handles events from the GUI.

3. ASP.NET is a platform that is used to host .NET applications allowing you to interact with HTTP request and responses. 

4. .NET is a platform that supports multiple languages with managed code to create applications.

5. Representational Entity State simply put is the architecture behind the World Wide Web. More specifically it allows the requesting system to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Stateless meaning no information is stored by the server or user and web resources meaning what the web page is using. 

6. AGILE programming is the theory of building an application that is flexible and can be changed to react accordingly to uses without the developer having build extensive coding initially.  

7. Unit testing is focused on testing smaller sections of code to ensure desired implementation without having to test the entire infrastructure of code. 

8. ASP.NET MVC was introduced in 2007. But the pattern of MVC dates back to 1978.

9.URL routing provides the creator with the ability to control the schema of a url tree and inherently the naming convention because it does not require you to adhere to a specific naming pattern. Clean URLs are easier to understand by the user making the user more inclined to utilize them, it optimizes search engine results, and web browsers are able to use them in their address bar.  

10..NET is the parent to MVC and .NET provides you with the ability to use precreated components and write code in any .NET language while also being able to access the same API features. 

11. the pattern - the model is responisble for manging the data of an application, it receives user input from the controller. the view means the presentation of that data and the controller is responsible for responding to user input and performs interactions pn the data. 
- model - the central component of the pattern. it expresses the applications behavior in terms of the problem domain, independent of the user interface. It directly manages data, logic, an rules of application.
- controller - the controller accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
- view - output representation of information. multiple views of the same information are possible such as a bar chart or tabular view of the same information.
