1. A view engine proceses ASP.NET content and looks for instructions, typically to insert dynamic content into the output sent to a browser 

2.Razor  is the name of the MVC framework view engine. 

3.Views render things to the user and also expose one or more aspects of the model to the user. 

4. when the compiler reads a @ symbol it knows what is following is a razor command. once razor is called, razor interprets the code accordingly.

5.Razor interprets what follows as is and not as code. 

6.Models only pass objects that contain information in the form of properties and views interpret the information into end user readable language.

7.It detracts from the pattern of MVC. 

8. A view start file is located in the views folder adn sets the default layout for a view.

9. A razor code block is C# that is interpreted and works inconjunction with views if applicable.

10.Action methods pass pbjects and views display those objects. 

11.the @using statement brings a specific namespace into scope the same way it does in a normal C# program.
