1. A compound operator is a combination of binary operators such as += and -=. they work by combining an assignment function with an arithmetic function.
2. +=, -+, /=, *=, %=
3.number=number+50 / number+=50; 
4.a while loop executes until a condition is false. the boolean expression must have a way of incrementing values in order to eventually evaluate to false 
5.it results in an infinite loop.
6.3 parts. initialization, boolean expression, increment; you can omit parts and if enough parts are omitted you result in having a very contrived version of a while loop.
7. you can guarantee a loop runs at least once by using a do-while structure. a do while executes the code statements then checks the boolean value at the end of the loop.
8.a break statement is used to exit out of a switch-case, if-else and iteration structure.
9. a continue statement causes the program to execute the next iteration of the loop after it reevaluated the boolean
