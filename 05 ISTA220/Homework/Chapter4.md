1. a true or false expression 
2. ==, !=, >=, <=, <, >, true, false 
3. its a way of preventing the program from progressing through its calculations. && - if the first value of an evaluation is false the program will not evaluate the second value; 
 if the value evaluates to true in the case of the || operator, the computer assumes both are true or if the first is false than both must be false. 
4. primary and assignment;  
5. the curly braces create a block where everything inside is the block of code to be executed. 
6. the operation will "fall through" or move onto the next block of code until it hits a break statement. this "fall through" can happen purposefully and planned 
or on accident if the break statement is not included when necessary;
