1. An array is a contiguous part of memory meaning everything in the array is stored in memory locations that are side by side.
2.Memory for arrays is stored on the heap.
3. An array reference is stored on the stack until it is implemented. 
4. An array can only hold values of the same data types according to the book unless the data type can be implicitly converted to the declared type such as an int can be a double but not vice versa. 
5. a foreach loop is declared as such foreach(datatype nameofvariable in nameofarray)
6. you instantiate a new array of the same data type and call a copy method to assign the values. the new array is created with the same amount of variables and the copy method iterates through every element and assign them individually to the new array. 
7. it provides a means of storing multiple variables in rows and columns. the key is the intersection of the variable. like x,y coords but there is no limit to how many rows and columns you can have so its more like x,y,z,a,b,c etc. 
8. You make an array of arrays.
