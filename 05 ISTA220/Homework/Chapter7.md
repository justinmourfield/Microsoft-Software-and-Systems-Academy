1. a class is short for classification and Classes provide a convenient mechanism for modeling the entities manipulated by applications. They arrange informaton and behaviors

2.Encapsulation has the purpose of combining methods and data with a class and control the accessibility to the methods and data.

3. you instantiate a class to create an object by using the new keyword followed by the name of the class you are trying to make an object from.

4.The defaul accessibility modifier of classes and fields are private but that can be changed by using the keyword public. Private should still be used to reduce ambiguity. 

5.a constructors syntax is as follows access modifier, name(which will be the same as the class), and any arguments that can be passed in.

6.class fields and methods utilize the static modifier which allows them to be used and manipulated without having to create an object first such as with instance fields and methods. you create class fields and methods by specifying them as static.

7. you bring a static class into scope by utilizing the using keyword the name of that class. you would do this to utilize a field or method within a class without having to create an object of that type first.

8. an anonymous class is a class that does not have a name. I would use this to create objects that dont necessarily have any behaviors but only contain variables that i need to interact with or manipulate.

9. Polymorphism is the term used to describe how a class can use the same method as other classes and the method has different behaviors depending on the types of parameters its given. 

10. message passing sends a message to a process such as an object and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual code to run. 

11.Simula

12.This quote presents the philosophical debate concerning how complex real world problems may not be able to be modeled by "objects" and that not everything in real life can be divided into classes because it leads to subjectivity of how to group these objects.
