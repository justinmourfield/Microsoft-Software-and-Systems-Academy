1. You define a method with an arbitrary amount of arguments by using the PARAMS keyword. 
2. access modifier return type methodname(PARAMS args) is the way you declare a variadic method. It is called by name and then args that are being input. 
3. You can use an array to pass an arbitrary amount of args unless it is a multidimensional array.
4. Technically a method can have as many arguments as you want but if a param arg is used it must be listed last in the list of args.
5.Param args do have to be of the same type.
6. A param argument can have multiple values that change. An optional argument is still a singular argument that is named and also initialized within the method of having a value that will be used in place of a new value if a corresponding argument is not passed into the method. 
7. You define a method that accepts an object type [] arg.
