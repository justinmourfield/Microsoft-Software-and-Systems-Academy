1. You would Queue data structure it is first in last out so the older data would dequeue first.

2. You would use a stack data structure. because it is first in first out 

3.A linked List because you can access in  stack or queue methodolody 

4.Hash Set is optomized for fast retrieval of data and operations to compute intersections and union of data

5.SortedList becauase the  values are paired together i.e.FN&LN and the key/value pair always stays together. 

6.Dictionary because the values are accessed with a key rather than an index. so the key is the username and the password is the value if userinput matches value then the password is correct and they cannot contain duplicate 

7.A lamba expression returns a method. Its like a summarixed method call that allows you to not explicitly name data types, pass values by reference, and a variety of other features that essentially form a lamba expression into a temporary one time use method unless defined again later in code. 

8. Anon methods primarily exist to define delegates without having to create a named method.
