1.An enumerable collection is a collection that implements the System.Collections.IEnumerable interface.

2.The IEnumerable has one method called GetEnumerator(). 

3.An IEnumerator interface has a interface has the property Current {get;} and the methods MoveNext(), and Reset().
 
4.The MoveNext() specifies the memory address of the next item in the collection and returns true or false. 

5.The Reset() redirects the pointer back to the beginning of the list and does not return a value. 

6.Both the IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces are not type safe however there is a generic implementation of both.

7.A recursive memory doesnt retain state because there is a new set on the stack to be executed. Essentially everything is reset to default with each new iteration of a recursive method.

8.You define an enumerator by using the GetEnumerator method and giving it a variable to return. 

9.An iterator is a block of code that yields an ordered sequence of values.

10.The yield keyword indicates the value that should be returned by each iteration.
